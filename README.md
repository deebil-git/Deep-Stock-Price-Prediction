### [Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/amousavi9/Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction) presents four efficient approaches for stock price forecasting

# Results
[stock_price_direction_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/amousavi9/Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/stock_price_direction_prediction.ipynb) use an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based deep learning approach to predict price direction.
The model is evaluated, reporting the classification accuracy on the test set of about 85%.

[Bitcoin_twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/amousavi9/Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Bitcoin_twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb) include two basic steps, Data extraction-cleaning and building the model to predict the Stock Closing Price.
After the data preprocessing steps, the confusion matrix showed high confusion between closing price, number of tweets, likes, replies and retweets.
