### [Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/amousavi9/Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction) presents four efficient approaches for stock price forecasting

# Results
[stock_price_direction_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/amousavi9/Deep-Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/stock_price_direction_prediction.ipynb) use an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based deep learning approach to predict price direction.
The model is evaluated, reporting the classification accuracy on the test set of about 85%
